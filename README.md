In this update, you can find the C++ code I developed for the Friends menu in the
SpaceWar sample project included as a part of the SteamWorks SDK.
The intention of this work is to offer users additional Steam friends presence information
and functionality and to provide developers with the information required to implement
these features into their projects as they plan to integrate and publish their games on
Steam.
For a quick and convenient browsing experience, C++ functions and contents highlighted
in bold in the accompanying PDF document are clickable. Clicking on each item will navigate to the desired

This addition is developed using Steamworks SDK version 151.
